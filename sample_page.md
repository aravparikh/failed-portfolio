## Introduction to solving large scale N-Body Problems

**Project description:** The N-body problem is a physics problem that was first understood the great himself, Newton. He was the first to solve this problem when he was able to map the trajectories of the planets in our solar system. The problem was then revisited in the 1960's by Rohklin & Greengard when they created the Fast Multi Pole method to understand the movement of (damn I forgot, edit later)... Now to what I am doing.: My interest in this specific algorithm is for ML & inevitably DL where problems in NLP tend to have (O)N^2 complex problems. 

### 1. The main problem with N-body problem is we do not understand gravity.

I think that there has to be a revaluation of the understanding of gravity and far field approximation that we use today to understand this problem.


```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
