### Data engineer in Hiberus Technology

Hybrid job - Zaragoza - Spain

**As Data engineer in January 2022 to present** 

**Companies focus**

- **Business Projects:**
I joined a consulting firm in January 2022 as a data engineer to create a lakehouse (data lake and data warehouse platforms) for different companies. The main clients in my first year (2022) were: Globalvia and Mahou.
For these clients, we develop a cloud solution, based on AWS, with Cloudformation as IaaC tools, python as programming language.

- **Public Client Projects:**
At the end of 2022 I started a new project, for the Ministry of Transport in Spain, to migrate on-premises infrastructure and centralize information from different sources into a Data Lake solution, such as SQL-Server, SSIS (integration services), PostgreSQL, Sharepoints files and more.
For this solution we decided to use the AWS provider, build an event-driven infrastructure with S3, EventBridge, Glue, Lambda function and Redshift as main services. The data was exploited using PowerBI dashboards. 

- **Industrial projects:**
In mid 2023 I joined an international team at BSH, Europe's largest appliance manufacturer. This challenger role involves working in an English environment and being prepared to assist the client with all cloud data lake issues.
Here we work responding to requests from cloud users, and with an annual plannings that evolves investigating new functionalities and solutions.
For example, I am part of a cleanup project that in the first 6 months saved about 20% of costs on EC2 and S3 services on the main AWS account.
By 2024 we plan to research and implement data governance solutions that help us have traceability of the origin and access to data.
