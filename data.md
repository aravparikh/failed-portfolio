## Data

**Problem Statement:** How does a city become an "innovation hub"? Using patent data as a way to measure innovation, our goal is to investigate the factors which contribute to this growth as a hub within a city. 

With the wealth of patent, demographic, geographic and business data available to us, our logistic regression models will identify the key features that determine a future of economic and innovative success of metropolitan statistical areas within the United States. 
<br>
Developing a model to determine and predict future inflection points will give an insight into the future innovative landscape for cities and investors. We will create an interactive application that will allow users to see more in depth visual analysis of the innovative landscape over time. The dimensions of innovation we will explore include the city's dynamic regulatory environment, socioeconomic structure and spatial density.


### Scope
To understand how this process develops, we will analyze more than thirty-five years of patent data in the United States from 1976-2014. Our regression analysis will explore three dimensions that influence the growth of innovation: regulation, socioeconomic diversity, and the spatial geography of the city.


### How we Measure Innovation

The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress in 1790 was titled "An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts."[​ 1]​ Ever since, the patent has been a key representation of innovation and progress in the United States. Keeping that in mind, this project looks into the ecosystem of innovation in the United States from 1976-2014 using the registry of patents as its foundational aspect. Our goal is to develop an innovation score and understand the urban structure that facilitates the growth of an innovation hub.


### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
