**General Overview 


For this project I wanted to take a look at the relationship between heavily contaminated areas (brownfields) and local water quality.
I already knew where to find the brownfield data, as it had been used for a lab last semester. 
For the water quality aspect of the project, my initial approach was to search for water quality data (specifically stream data) from  https://www.waterqualitydata.us/, but the data available there was not as useful as I had hoped it would be and I ultimately did not end up using it.


In order to find usable data, I poked around on the internet exploring the many and varied water quality datasets available. 
Amongst the many other files that I downloaded was the 2012 SPARROW models, which provided an estimated dataset for various measurements of phosphorous, nitrogen, and suspended solids content in catchements along the northeast US. 


After some experimentation with the many datasets that I had collected, I found that
