General Plan

For this project I intend expand upon a lab done in GES 386 and analyze the distribution of brownfield sites in across Maryland

I think it may be interesting to map the distribution of brownfield sites alongside water quality maps for MD. While I imagine that there will be a fairly strong correlation, the patterns that are found might lead to more focused questions down the line.

The brownfield data for Maryland is readily available at https://mdewin64.mde.state.md.us/LRP/index.html, and I have found a good source of water quality data here https://www.waterqualitydata.us/

Future me will expand on this probably, the data is downloading slowly but I'll have a better idea of what exactly I want to do once I can poke around in it a bit
