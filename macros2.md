## Customer Service Macros

**What are macros?** 

A macro is a pre-written response for customer-facing use, commonly used in help desk software services such as Zendesk or Salesforce. Macros save time, increase productivity, ensure accuracy, and reduce error. 

I create and maintain a repository of over 200 macros for a customer support team.
