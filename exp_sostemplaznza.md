#### Freelance web developer - UR

Remote job
March 2014 to December 2016

I developed a web shift system for a doctor without borders dedicated to alternative medicine.
The doctor is Octavio Meneghetti and he treats patients from Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
This system is used by the secretaries of the different offices where the doctor attends.  He keeps a monthly and daily calendar of the different people he cares for and the extra activities carried out by the doctor such as conferences and talks in the media. It has integration with telephone message systems to remind patients of their turn.
