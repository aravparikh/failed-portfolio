## [Web Scraper for Public Housing Transaction Data](https://github.com/johnthwong/housing-authority-scraper)
The Housing Authority's data on secondary transactions of government-built, privately-owned flats are notoriously difficult to access as data must be requested with a separate web form for each month. The Housing Authority Scraper gathers the transaction count of these flats by month and year and generates a CSV file that can be easily used for further research, such as the analysis of housing market momentum or affordability.
