# Innovation Hubs - A Story of Cities and Patents

# Abstract

_In recent years there has been great interest around cities and their new product output, where they are usually labeled as ‘innovation hubs’ or ‘tech hubs’._

 This capstone project will investigate the factors that facilitate innovation growth within a city using publicly available patent data. To understand how this process develops, we will analyze patent data in the United States from 2000-2014. Our regression analysis will explore many features that influence the growth of innovation. Upon running multiple analyses across the years we find that there are in fact certain features that have higher influence on patent output amongst the top outputting cities. We also find these features are missing among cities with less patent output. What this experiment would recommend to  cities desiring greater patent output is that they should  invest in higher education, in earning SBIR grants, and looking into becoming empowerment zones.

## How we Measure Innovation

<p>The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress in 1790 was titled "An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts. Ever since, the patent has been a key representation of innovation and progress in the United States. Keeping that in mind, this project looks into the ecosystem of innovation in the United States from 1976-2014 using the registry of patents as its foundational aspect. Our goal is to develop an innovation score and understand the urban structure that facilitates the growth of an innovation hub.</p>
