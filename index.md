### Simulating Vaccine Distribution Strategies in an Epidemic 

I simulated a short-term epidemic spread in Python to assess the impact of mitigation strategies like social distancing and vaccinations. All output analysis was conducted in R.

### Identifying Brain Proteins Critical for Learning in Mice with Down Syndrome

An attempt at replicating the results of the 2015 paper “Self-Organizing Feature Maps Identify Proteins Critical to Learning in a Mouse Model of Down Syndrome,” using a combination of non-linear dimensionality reduction and spectral clustering. The authors of the original paper have used self-organizing feature maps (SOM).
