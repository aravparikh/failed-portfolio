<!--### Research Interests-->
I am Daeun(Dah-Unn) Jung, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science Department at University of Maryland, College Park working with Tianyi Zhow. Prior to UMD, I received undergraduate and master degrees in Electrical Engineering from Ewha Womans University in 2020.

My research interest lies primarily in the fields of extracting representative features to help understand the
mechanism of learning and get inference better with more emphasis on time series data. I believe there is
passing through information, and I could find it from partial data information with data distribution changing. Here
are some of my interests:

* Extract key features under data distribution changing environment
* Understand the causation and relation in variables of time series data
* Adapt Federated learning to overcome data imbalance in time series data
