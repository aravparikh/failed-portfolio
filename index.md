                  One popular game has tried to solve the problem of the declining geographic knowledge of the United States for almost the last 40 years. “Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego” is a video game turned game show, turned television show.</p>
                  <p>Geography is not everything, in addition to the terrain, one also needs to know about the people who live and work there. This work merges geography with census data to provide details on demographics, disability proportions, and populations to name a few criteria. To improve the world, all it takes is for one person to learn more than they knew the day before. So, gumshoe, as we follow in the footsteps of IBM, PBS, and Netflix, there is just one question left to answer: “Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego?”.
