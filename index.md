<!--### Research Interests-->
My research interest lies primarily in the fields of extracting representative features to help understand the
mechanism of learning and get inference better with more emphasis on time series data. I believe there is
passing through information, and I could find it from partial data information with data distribution changing. Here
are some of my interests:

* Extract key features under data distribution changing environment
* Understand the causation and relation in variables of time series data
* Adapt Federated learning to overcome data imbalance in time series data
