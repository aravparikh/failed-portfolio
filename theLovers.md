I asked my father as well as consulted <a href="https://www.guampedia.com/">Guampedia<</a> for quite a bit of my research!

  <br>Preliminary sketches of the protagonist and the sequential boss in all of their forms.

I interpreted my randomly selected words "Sunken Metropolis" as an underwater city, although I played with the idea of a cave or sink hole. Each character has five silhouettes to play with shape and three refined sketches.

*Protagonist*
The silhouettes I was playing with the different weapons and vibes the protagonist would have. For the sketches I wanted to explore different motives and how that would reflect him as a character.

Left: I imagined him as an honour bound, eldest son. He left his family in search of the chief's "daughter" to help his mother. He is serious and more in touch with his roots as seen by his traditional dress and patterns. He has a shell necklace and his hair was forcibly cut.

Middle: This was was cocky and energetic, the younger brother. His motive was to raise his social class and gain wealth for his mother, as well as glory. Due to his age, he is more susceptible to Spanish colonizer's words. He sports a shirt which became the average dress because the Spainards found their nudity appalling. He still wears a shell necklace and his shorts have some traditional patterns. His hair was forcibly cut.

Right: For my third idea, I went for someone who wanted to look for the chief's "daughter" for the glory and acceptance of the Spaniards. Although one isn't necessarily suppose to wear rosaries, he has a rosary around his neck in place of a necklace and willingly cut and styled his hair. His clothing silhouette is inspired by Spanish fashion at the time. Due to his young age, I imagine he would have grown up under the Spainard rule and knows less about his culture.

All of them have a dolphin tattoo on their leg, I remember my father having the same tattoo and he told me it was to protect him when he went into the ocean. Trying to create the protagonist was interesting! I knew I wanted a sympathetic antagonist, but I wanted to be careful of how I depicted the protagonist, in case I would accidentally make unsavory implications. Both the bosses and the protagonists are victims of the violence of colonialism, so this sort of nuance is important to me.

*Bosses*

I knew I wanted to keep them intertwined, perfectly in sync together. 

I had an idea of their personalities based on the legend - the CHamoru man, Hirao, was described as kind. Inspired by that I wanted to him to be the calm and defender from the two. He wouldn't hit as hard or as much because he doesn't want to fight, but he wouldn't leave his lover. In the later scenes, when he loses him, the contrast between his usual softer self and what he has become would become more stark this way. 

Because of his status as the chief's son I imagined he'd be more confident and striking - the instigator and main attacker. He moves swiftly. While both are growing fish-like qualities,
