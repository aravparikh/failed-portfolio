      <p>
          With a background in Auditing and Reporting in Cybersecurity, I specialize in cleaning and handling large
          amounts of data, producing insightful reports with strong attention to detail, and presenting them to
          stakeholders. Having worked with data throughout my career, my transition to a full-time Data Analyst felt like
          a natural choice.

          Driven by a genuine curiosity and a knack for problem-solving, I enjoy tackling complex problems and turning
          challenges into opportunities. I am keen about bridging the gap between numbers and real-world implications for
          the business and bringing value to an organization. Being a confident presenter and an effective collaborator, I
          have the ability to present complex insights in an accessible and user-friendly way.

          Iâ€™m passionate to use my expertise to analyze larger data sets and draw insights that can guide business
          decisions and lead to success.
