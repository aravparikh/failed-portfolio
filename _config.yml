  I've consulted government agencies, legislators, and developers on macroeconomics, urban development, and clean energy. As a data scientist, I use R and Python for machine learning, web scraping, forecasting, causal inference, and data visualization. As a public sector consultant, I also assess impact, benchmark policies, and engage stakeholders.
